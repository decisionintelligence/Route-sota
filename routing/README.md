# Routing Algorithms
7 routing algorithms are implemented in paper. 
These require files stored in the `data` directory, and which are generated using the python programs in the `generate` directory.
Before running any of these, it 

A user-guide for how to run one of these can be found in the user-guide in the outermost readme.
